## Description
_A vote-based discussion board, users can up vote or down vote content. The more up votes an item receives, the higher it's displayed on the list. The application meets the following user stories:_

* _As a user, I want to enter content into a form and submit to create a new post._
* _As a user, I want my new posts to include a timestamp. And I want to see when other listings were posted, too._
* _As a user, I want to up vote posts I particularly enjoy._
* _As a user, I want to down vote posts I don't like, or find inappropriate._
* _As a user, I'd like posts with the most up votes to appear higher on the page. (We haven't explicitly covered this in our curriculum, but here's a hint: You can complete logic before the return statement of a mapStateToProps() method!)_
